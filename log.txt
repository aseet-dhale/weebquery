Tried using Vibrant.js for vibrant color. Had issues. Will try locally first.
Used Vibrant.js but getting difficulty in using it to dynamically color the card.
Will try using Class Component instead of Functional Component for async dynamic coloring.

Successfully implemented dynamic coloring of cards without using class component.
Instead changed the color by using the promise from Vibrant.js and applying the id to the element.

Tried react-spring for animation. Feels like its a long way to go. Will try again later.
